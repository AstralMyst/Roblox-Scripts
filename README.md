# Roblox-Scripts
Roblox scripts *(not exploiting scripts)* that game developers on Roblox may find useful

**11/14 added first code -- render distance**
  - there is a lack of well-written render distance scripts in the Roblox Creator Marketplace
  - I needed to reduce lag b/c of number of parts and wireframes rendered
  - This will be useful code for me to apply in various future games. :D
  - Use a local script, place in PlayerScripts

**11/17 added second code -- simple for loop for unanchoring**
  - A very commonly used snippet of code I use
  - Straightforward
  - Useful in any script ^u^
